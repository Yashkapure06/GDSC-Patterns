So Follow these steps:


*  First of all you guys will have to fork this repo<br>

* As in above Image you are seeing Test.js But in real You will have to create a fileName like `yourname_lastName.(extention)` your code can be in any language
* And When you commit the code you will just have to commit:  `"PatternName Created by YourName"`

* Next You have to click on <b>Contribute</b> option and <b>open pull request</b> <br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61585443/191575025-d445c5fb-97b4-4ec9-b15f-87275ae83f10.png)

![ss3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61585443/191575851-a82470e5-43bd-476e-ad4e-17e440c1eff2.png)
