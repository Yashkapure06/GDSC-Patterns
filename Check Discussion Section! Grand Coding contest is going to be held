Hacktoberfest is back for its ninth year! Our friends at DigitalOcean host an annual celebration encouraging
open source contributions during the month of October. We all use and depend on open source to power our digital world. 
In the past year alone, we saw over 2.6 billion contributions on GitHub! Hacktoberfest is a great way to give back to the open source projects we all depend on. âœ¨

#More than code ðŸŽ‰
While code contributions are top of mind when it comes to open source, projects often desperately need non-code contributions
like writing, design, advocacy, and financial contributions.
This year, consider writing some docs, designing a logo, or scheduling a few tweets to support your favourite open source community. 
You donâ€™t have to be a technical expert to make a difference!
